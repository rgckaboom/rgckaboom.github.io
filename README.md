# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This website in not fully functional but I intend to make it so by the time 
I complete the course. Its just a very early prototype but I made sure to meet
all the requirements mentioned in the project0 page.

When complete it will allow users to share their books with other people in
their locality (in my case our University) and thus giving them an opportunity
 to meet more like minded people as I observed it is something which our 
locality lacks, a platform for like minded people to meet and socialize.

Thank you for the great course, take care and stay safe.
